## Python
python is an object-oriented language

## Output 
Output is the way the computer prints out information to the user in the "console"

To output we use `print()`

## Comments 
Comments are notes that the compiler skips over

To use comments, we use `# COMMENT` for single-line

we use `'''COMMENT'''` for block comments 

## Data Types

We will be working with 5 main data types

1. Integer (int) - whole numbers
2. Character(char) - a single letter/symbol/number
3. a string(str) - collection of characters
4. Floating point(float) - decimal numbers
5. Boolean(bool) - True(1)/False(2)

## Variables
Variables are containers that hold a value

### Rules for variable names
1. Always start with a letter `1name="Elijah"` --> not alllowed
2. 2. Can only contain numbers, letters. and underscores (_) ` my name = "Elijah"-->NOt ALLOWED
   3. If more than one word, use camelCase or underscores to separate words
      `myElijah` or `my_elijah`

      ## Concatenation
      `+` Adding strings together, appending (add to end)

      `"Hello " + "World" = "Hello World"

      ## Type Cast
      Forcing a data type on a value

      ### To force an integer into a string
      `str(variableName)`

      ### To force a string into an integer
      `int(variableName)`
